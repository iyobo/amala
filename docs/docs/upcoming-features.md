# Upcoming Features

## Customizable validators
The ability to choose and configure different input validation engines besides class-validators.

## OpenAPI improvements
Amala's OpenAPI spec-gen support could be better. For example, headers cannot be passed in just yet which would be useful for testing various things like auth and bearer tokens.
