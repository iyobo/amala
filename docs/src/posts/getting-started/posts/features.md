We tried to make a simple but well-structured theme. Managing the content is straightforward but still comes with some helpful features.

## Eleventy

- Breadcrumb navigation built on [11ty Navigation Plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/).
- HTML minification in production mode.
- Anchor headings.
- Table of Content.
- FAQ template.
- Changelog template.
- Static search integration with [pagefind](https://pagefind.app/).
- Code highlighting.
- [svgIcon](https://github.com/conedevelopment/sprucecss-eleventy-documentation-template/blob/main/src/shortcodes/svg-icon.js) shortcode: render any SVG icon inline and add optional classes.
- [markdownRenderer](https://github.com/conedevelopment/sprucecss-eleventy-documentation-template/blob/main/src/shortcodes/markdown-render.js): render any string (markdown) into HTML.

## CSS Customization

The template utilizes Spruce CSS and some of its components. You can learn more about the customization on the [official documentation](https://sprucecss.com/).
