**Amala** is a decorator-based API framework for KoaJS v2+ and Typescript.
Amala is fast, light, self-documenting and Docker-ready; Perfect for microservices.

- Define your REST API endpoints using ES8 _classes_ and _decorators_.
- Inject arguments into your endpoint handlers, effectively turning your controller endpoints into standalone, testable service endpoints.
- Clean, light and FAST endpoints. Powered by Koa.
- No further magic past decorators. Full access to underlying Koa app.
- Project creator comes with fully configured Docker and Docker-compose settings for quick containerization.
- In-built OpenAPI spec exporter and Swagger UI!

This leads to clean, self-documenting API endpoints and makes it so you can re-use those service endpoints elsewhere.
It also makes your endpoint endpoints easier to test.
